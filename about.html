				<h4>Rachel</h4>
				<p>
					Hi, thanks so much for stopping by. I’m Rachel and I operate this blog. I bake too much, watch way more hours of Food Network programing than I care to admit publicly, I stay up too late and eat way too much sugar. By day, I teach middle school, but during the evenings and weekends I am in the kitchen cooking and baking delectable dishes and desserts. My dream is to have my own cooking channel and I hope that this blog help me reach my goal!

				<h4>Sara</h4>
				<p>
					I’m Sara. I like to take pictures, write, and bake. Scratch that, I’m addicted to baking. The kitchen is where my creative juices flow and We Love Food! is where I can share it all with you. Often with a lot of sprinkles and even more exclamation points. I’m a self-taught, mom-taught, grandma-taught baker.  My favorite dessert is apple pie, coffee keeps me sane, running keeps me content, yoga keeps me balanced. The motivation for this site to me during my mid-twenties. At the time I worked in finance and felt a little lost in both my career and my life. I tapped into my many, many, MANY memories being in the kitchen when I was younger, picked up a camera (taught myself how to use it!), and the rest is history.
